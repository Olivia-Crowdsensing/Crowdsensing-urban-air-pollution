# Crowdsensing-urban-air-pollution

This repository contains code and example data for an manuscript of crowdsensing facilitates fine-grained PM2.5 estimation and health burden analysis. The study focuses on PM₂.₅ estimation using two complementary approaches: GCN-based interpolation and image-based air quality estimation.

Overview
1. GCN-based Interpolation
Complete implementation available
This module provides a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approach for interpolation of PM2.5 measurements. Synthetic data under various heterogeneity is also provided.

2. Image-based PM₂.₅ Estimation
Due to publication constraints, we provide only the basic framework for the image-based PM₂.₅ estimation approach.
The complete implementation will be released upon publication of the manuscript.
